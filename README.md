# AI tools for Economists
Some tools for Economists to unlock the potential of LLMs

## Generative AI for Economic Research
Take a look at https://genaiforecon.org/. Relevant use cases and implications for economists by Anton Korinek: he will publish updates until end of 2025 at least.

## Open AI's API
- APIs allow to unlock the full potential of LLMs.
  - Customizable, programmable, and easy to integrate.
  - Use structured prompts and chaining to generate reproducible outputs.
- Example with OpenAI’s API for batch processing: [Official docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch/batch-api), [Quick Guide](https://www.rootstrap.com/blog/quick-guide-for-sending-multiple-requests-to-gpt-with-the-openai-batch-api) and [Sketch notebook](openai_batch_processing_tutorial.ipynb)
  - Get an API key (“API credit card”).
  - Choose parameters (model, temperature)
  - Code to create a query, give context, upload data, and download.
    - Imprortant to give context/examples!
    - Useful to ask LLM to think (why?) before answering
   
## Useful tools
- Download ChatGPT desktop
  - Try voice mode
  - Canvas allows for more interactive prompting to elaborate sketches of anything
  - [ChatGPT for macOS can now edit code directly in IDEs](https://xcancel.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1897700857833193955#m)
- Korinek recommends Claude from Anthropic for writing
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding in almost any language (including R and Stata), LaTeX, Jupyter notebooks, visualizing data, and almost anything
  - Take advantage of LLMs and code with Copilot
    - Students and teachers get [free access](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application)
  - R is easy to get ready. STATA is only a bit trickier: [here](https://gdeiana.github.io/economics/stata-vscode/) and [here](https://github.com/wulizyk/Notebook_Stata/wiki/Run-STATA-in-VScode)
  - Start using git! The student developer package gives you GitHub pro and GitKraken
- Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to code online for free (supports Python, R & Julia)
  - Useful to share code and have same libraries with colleagues, install libraries you'll only use once, download temporary data and more
- Transcribe audio
  - You can upload audio to to Microsoft Word and it will transcribe it for you (then you can upload to ChatGPT for analysis/summary!)
  - Google Docs can transcribe live!
