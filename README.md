Some tools for Economists to unlock the potential of LLMs

## Generative AI for Economic Research
Take a look at https://genaiforecon.org/. Relevant use cases and implications for economists by Anton Korinek: he will publish updates until end of 2025 at least.

## Open AI's API
- APIs allow to unlock the full potential of LLMs.
  - Customizable, programmable, and easy to integrate.
  - Use structured prompts and chaining to generate reproducible outputs.
- Example with OpenAI’s API for batch processing: [Tutorial](openai_batch_processing_tutorial.ipynb)
  - Get an API key (“API credit card”).
  - Choose parameters (model, temperature)
  - Code to create a query, give context, upload data, and download.
    - Imprortant to give context/examples!
    - Useful to ask LLM to think (why?) before answering
   
## General tools
- Download ChatGPT desktop
  - Try voice mode
  - Canvas allows for more interactive prompting to elaborate sketches of anything
  - [ChatGPT for macOS can now edit code directly in IDEs](https://xcancel.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1897700857833193955#m)
- Korinek recommends Claude from Anthropic for writing
- Students and teachers get free [Copilot](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application)!
  - Different LLM models for free, mostly for coding and data analysis
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding in almost any language, LaTeX, Jupyter notebooks, visualizing data, and almost anything.
  - Copilot integrated perfectly to modify and suggest code easily in any language (including STATA, R, Tex)
  - R is easy to get ready. STATA is only a bit trickier: [here](https://gdeiana.github.io/economics/stata-vscode/) and [here](https://github.com/wulizyk/Notebook_Stata/wiki/Run-STATA-in-VScode)
  - Start using git! The student developer package gives you GitHub pro and GitKraken
